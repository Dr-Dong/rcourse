## Course Description

This is an introduction to the R statistical programming language, focusing on
essential skills needs to perform data analysis from entry, to preparation, analysis,
and finally presentation.  During the minicourse, you will not only learn basic
R functionality, but also how to leverage the exensive community-driven package 
ecosystem, as well as how to write your own functions in R.

Course content is broken up into 6 seminars, each covering one content module,
with a short session additional session on Bayesian methods at the end for those 
interested. The length of each seminar may vary from module to module, but should 
generally be less than 3 hours.  The first 30-45 minutes will be used to introduce 
new information, while the remainder of the time will be spent doing hands-on 
practice.  The content for each module will be posted the day before the seminar,
so that you can famliarize yourself with the material ahead of time if you like 
(though this isn't required).

### Module 2:  Data Manipulation Using the Tidyverse

This module introduces a series of tools for data manipulation/preparation 
collectively known as the "Tidyverse."  Covers how to subset data, arrange it,
transform it, and aggregate it.  Participants will also learn convenient tools to
import and export data.
