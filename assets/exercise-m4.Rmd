### Create a project with remote version control

- From GitHub, create a new repository for the R minicourse.  Remember to initialize it 
with a ReadMe file.  

- In RStudio, then create a new project with remote version control, setting it 
up for use with the online repository you've just created.

- Now as make changes on the document below, use version control to routinely 
update your documents on GitHub.

### Create a PDF document with Module 3 Exercise instructions and results

- Using the Module 3 instructions and either your own code or the suggested 
solutions code to Module 3 exercises, try to create a single PDF document which 
shows:
  
    + The instructions for each task, formatted as in the PDF,
    + Your code
    + The output of each step.  If a step doesn't have any explicit output, 
    print the tibbles that result from changes you make in the given step.

- Make sure the results have the following:

    + Code highlighting with your style of choice
    + A table of contents
    + Dataframes printed as tibbles
    
#### Create an HTML copy

Now that you have a PDF copy, try saving a new copy of your RMarkdown file that 
you will then use to generate the same document as a webpage.

- After saving the new copy, change the output type so that it is a HTML document. 

- Choose a theme for your HTML page.

- Change the chunks so that there is 
[code folding](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#code_folding). 
Also check out what happens if you instead set *echo* to FALSE for some chunks.

- Change the dataframe printing to Kable, looking at the dataframe after each 
step using [head()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.3/topics/head) 
instead of displaying the data frame itself.

#### Now create a Beamer presentation copy

Once again, save another copy of your work, now for use in generating a Beamer 
presentation (you can try out other presentation types if you prefer).

- This time, keep [head()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.3/topics/head) 
in the document but set the chunk options so that no output is displayed, just 
the code itself.

- Choose a Beamer Theme and Color Theme to apply to your presentation.  Check out 
the RStudio page on how to specify these options [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html#themes) 
and then choose a theme and color theme from the [Theme Matrix](https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/).

- Try adding an [image](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/99/9903c7c14add3fd0758b7b5b80c24d48101f296f13ce34736799a82c71f61bc2.jpg) to the last slide of
your presentation.
